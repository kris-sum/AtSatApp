# AtSatApp
A challenge project for NASA's International Space App challenge - Space Station Telemetry App.

Not only is the International Space Station detatched from us on earth physically but also emotionally.
We decided to use approach the challenge with the aim of trying using data to try and bring those of us on Earth closer to the ISS.
